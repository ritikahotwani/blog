Hola Amigos!

As I embark upon this new odyssey of sharing insights and wisdom, allow me to extend a cordial introduction and offer a glimpse into the trajectory of this blog.

## About Me:
I am Ritika Hotwani, a final-year student pursuing Computer Science with a minor in Data Science. My passions span a spectrum from sketching and painting to dancing and cooking, all seamlessly intertwined with my love for coding. Through this platform, I aspire to distill and share the wealth of knowledge I've accrued, ranging from coding exploits to navigating the complexities of placements and academic rigors.

## The Plan:
My initial foray will revolve around an illuminating series delving into the concepts of the JAVA language, a cornerstone in my triumphs during placement.Furthermore, I'll continue to share personal insights on matters such as navigating the selection of your tech stack and sustaining academic excellence with a 9 GPA, among other compelling topics.

Stay tuned!ðŸ˜„
