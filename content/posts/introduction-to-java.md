### What is JAVA

Java is a programming language and a computing platform. It is used for:
- Mobile applications (Android apps)
- Desktop applications
- Web applications
- Web servers and application servers
- Games
- Database connection
- And much, much more!

To it's core, JAVA is a object-oriented programming language.

### Object Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the
concept of objects.

Objects are nothing but the instances of classes.

A class is a blueprint for creating objects.

Class defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects
of that class will have.

*Benefits of OOP include code modularity,reusability, scalability and
efficiency.*

### How does JAVA work

In the most simple terms,

##### 1. Process of Compilation

The java source code(.java file) is converted to byte code(.class file) by the
JAVA compiler(JDK).

##### 2. Process of Interpretation

The byte code is then converted to machine code/native code by the JAVA
interpreter(JVM). <!-- ![alt text](images/java.png) --> <div

### Why did I choose JAVA over other languages

To be brutally honest, in my first year of college when I was struggling with
choosing one language I scrolled through a few youtube videos, read people's
experience through blogs, LinkedIn posts. All I heard *clear your interviews
with JAVA and C++*. Not being a big fan of C, I decided to go for JAVA.

But with a few months of experience in working with JAVA, I realised it had a
vast comunity support, simpler syntax, clear documentation and **most
importantly no more pointers and memory management(reference languages:C,C++)**

Further ahead we will be diving deep into JVM,JDK,JIT.

Stay tuned!ðŸ˜„
